      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like April and May, I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to give bimonthly rather than monthly
reports. As usual it was a busy couple of months. See the end of the report for
the team&amp;rsquo;s full changelog of patches contributed to Apache Arrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our last report was for March 2019, so I have rolled up two months
into one. There have been a number of exciting developments in the
project in the last couple of months. See the end of the report for
the team&amp;rsquo;s full changelog of patches contributed to Apache Arrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first quarter of 2019 has now wrapped up. In March we spent a good amount
of time focused on getting the 0.13.0 Apache Arrow release out of the door. I
will mention a few development highlights from the month and provide the full
changelog of patches later in the post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The team had a busy 28 days this February. The Apache Arrow community is
discussing a 0.13 release toward the end of March, so we spent February helping
the project toward the next release milestone. We have been pushing projects on
multiple fronts and discuss some of those here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ursa Labs January 2019 Report</title>
      <link>https://ursalabs.org/blog/2019-01/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a busy January that went by too quickly. After a high-intensity 3 months
of development, we helped release &lt;a href=&#34;http://arrow.apache.org/release/0.12.0.html&#34;&gt;Apache Arrow 0.12&lt;/a&gt; on January 20th. A
good chunk of our time was spent fighting fires (in packaging and builds)
related to the continued expansion of the project in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
