      <title>Introducing Conbench</title>

      <description>Join us in welcoming a new tool to the Apache Arrow project: Conbench.
Conbench is a language independent, continuous benchmarking framework, built specifically with the needs of a cross-language, platform-independent, high-performance project like Arrow in mind.
Conbench allows you to write benchmarks in any language, publish the results as JSON via an API, and persist them for comparison while iterating on performance improvements or to guard against regressions.
In addition to benchmark results, Conbench will also collect machine information relevant to hardware specific optimizations (architecture, CPU info, L1d/L1i/L2/L3 cache info, etc), and any applicable context, configurable per project (like git revision, compiler flags, benchmark language version, etc).</description>

      <title>Measuring and Monitoring Arrow&#39;s Performance: Some Updated R Benchmarks</title>

      <description>The Apache Arrow project defines a standardized, language-agnostic, columnar data format optimized for speed and efficiency. But a fast in-memory format is valuable only if you can read data into it and write data out of it, so Arrow libraries include methods for working with common file formats including CSV, JSON, and Parquet, as well as Feather, which is Arrow on disk. By using Arrow libraries, developers of analytic data systems can avoid the hassle of implementing their own methods for reading and writing data in these formats.</description>

      <title>Toward an Arrow-native world: the next stage of the Ursa journey</title>

      <description>Since launching Ursa Labs in 2018, we have made extraordinary progress growing the Apache Arrow project and supporting the open source community around it. As I explained in my announcement of the initiative, our objective has been to create a robust engineering team in partnership with a wide variety of sponsoring companies with the Arrow project&amp;rsquo;s success as our number one priority. Since then, we have added NVIDIA, Intel, Bloomberg, G-Research, and OneSixtyTwo Technologies (and some others we cannot name publicly) to our sponsor ranks, joining our founding sponsors RStudio and Two Sigma.</description>

      <description>We founded Ursa Labs in 2018 to build a team to enable Apache Arrow to be a robust and reliable next-generation computational foundation for in-memory analytics and data science. To make this possible, we partnered with RStudio, Two Sigma, and several other corporate sponsors to secure the financial support for a group of full time open source developers. In part through our efforts, Arrow is now installed more than ten million times per month by Python and R users and has quickly become one of the most important technologies for working with large tabular datasets.</description>

      <title>Feather V2 with Compression Support in Apache Arrow 0.17.0</title>
      <link>https://ursalabs.org/blog/2020-feather-v2/</link>

      <guid>https://ursalabs.org/blog/2020-feather-v2/</guid>
      <description>Back in October 2019, we took a look at performance and file sizes for a handful of binary file formats for storing data frames in Python and R. These included Apache Parquet, Feather, and FST.
In the intervening months, we have developed &amp;ldquo;Feather V2&amp;rdquo;, an evolved version of the Feather format with compression support and complete coverage for Arrow data types. In this post, we explain what Feather V2 is and what you might find it useful.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast pandas DataFrame loading from Apache Arrow</title>

      <description>A Surprising Performance Experiment To start off this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;ll present a surprising fact. The pyarrow library is able to construct a pandas.DataFrame faster than using pandas.DataFrame directly in some cases. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look.
First, I make a dict of 100 NumPy arrays of float64 type, a little under 800 megabytes of data:
import pandas as pd import pyarrow as pa import numpy as np num_rows = 1_000_000 num_columns = 100 arr = np.</description>

      <description>2020 in Apache Arrow development has gotten off to a running start with a 0.16.0 major release around the corner and a 1.0.0 release (including protocol stability guarantees) coming with luck in the first half of the year.
In this blog post, we would like to summarize Ursa Labs development highlights from 2019 and highlight our major focus areas and priorities for 2020. Apache Arrow libraries provide an efficient and high performance development platform that addresses, broadly speaking:</description>

      <title>Ursa Labs Team Report August to December 2019</title>
      <link>https://ursalabs.org/blog/2019-12-19-eoy-report/</link>

      <guid>https://ursalabs.org/blog/2019-12-19-eoy-report/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With a busy fall full of development and some travel I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to keep up
with monthly or bi-monthly reports, so this report gives highlights about the
Ursa Labs team&amp;rsquo;s work from August up until now. With 2019 nearly behind us,
this also gives us a moment to reflect on everything that&amp;rsquo;s been accomplished
this year and look forward to next year. We hope to write a blog post soon
discussing the big picture plan ahead for 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Columnar File Performance Check-in for Python and R: Parquet, Feather, and FST</title>
      <link>https://ursalabs.org/blog/2019-10-columnar-perf/</link>

      <guid>https://ursalabs.org/blog/2019-10-columnar-perf/</guid>
      <description>Since the founding of Ursa Labs in 2018, one of our focus areas has been accelerating data access to binary file formats for Python and R programmers. My first semi-formal collaboration with the R community was the creation of the Feather file format with Hadley Wickham shortly after the Apache Arrow project was started. Since then I have focused my energy on the Arrow project to build high performance data processing infrastructure.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like April and May, I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to give bimonthly rather than monthly
reports. As usual it was a busy couple of months. See the end of the report for
the team&amp;rsquo;s full changelog of patches contributed to Apache Arrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our last report was for March 2019, so I have rolled up two months
into one. There have been a number of exciting developments in the
project in the last couple of months. See the end of the report for
the team&amp;rsquo;s full changelog of patches contributed to Apache Arrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first quarter of 2019 has now wrapped up. In March we spent a good amount
of time focused on getting the 0.13.0 Apache Arrow release out of the door. I
will mention a few development highlights from the month and provide the full
changelog of patches later in the post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ursa Labs February 2019 Report</title>

      <guid>https://ursalabs.org/blog/2019-02/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The team had a busy 28 days this February. The Apache Arrow community is
discussing a 0.13 release toward the end of March, so we spent February helping
the project toward the next release milestone. We have been pushing projects on
multiple fronts and discuss some of those here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ursalabs.org/blog/2019-01/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a busy January that went by too quickly. After a high-intensity 3 months
of development, we helped release &lt;a href=&#34;http://arrow.apache.org/release/0.12.0.html&#34;&gt;Apache Arrow 0.12&lt;/a&gt; on January 20th. A
good chunk of our time was spent fighting fires (in packaging and builds)
related to the continued expansion of the project in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that NVIDIA AI Labs has signed on as a supporter of Ursa Labs. NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s new open source RAPIDS data science platform uses Apache Arrow for an interoperable representation of tabular data (data frames). We are looking forward to collaborating on our respective development roadmaps and growing the ecosystem of projects that use Arrow.
This new financial support will enable us to grow our team of full-time open source software developers.</description>
