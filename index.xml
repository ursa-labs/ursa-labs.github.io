      <title>Ursa Labs Team Report August to December 2019</title>
      <link>https://ursalabs.org/blog/2019-12-19-eoy-report/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With a busy fall full of development and some travel I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to keep up
with monthly or bi-monthly reports, so this report gives highlights about the
Ursa Labs team&amp;rsquo;s work from August up until now. With 2019 nearly behind us,
this also gives us a moment to reflect on everything that&amp;rsquo;s been accomplished
this year and look forward to next year. We hope to write a blog post soon
discussing the big picture plan ahead for 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Columnar File Performance Check-in for Python and R: Parquet, Feather, and FST</title>
      <link>https://ursalabs.org/blog/2019-10-columnar-perf/</link>

      <description>Since the founding of Ursa Labs in 2018, one of our focus areas has been accelerating data access to binary file formats for Python and R programmers. My first semi-formal collaboration with the R community was the creation of the Feather file format with Hadley Wickham shortly after the Apache Arrow project was started. Since then I have focused my energy on the Arrow project to build high performance data processing infrastructure.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like April and May, I&amp;rsquo;m continuing to give bimonthly rather than monthly
reports. As usual it was a busy couple of months. See the end of the report for
the team&amp;rsquo;s full changelog of patches contributed to Apache Arrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our last report was for March 2019, so I have rolled up two months
into one. There have been a number of exciting developments in the
project in the last couple of months. See the end of the report for
the team&amp;rsquo;s full changelog of patches contributed to Apache Arrow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first quarter of 2019 has now wrapped up. In March we spent a good amount
of time focused on getting the 0.13.0 Apache Arrow release out of the door. I
will mention a few development highlights from the month and provide the full
changelog of patches later in the post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The team had a busy 28 days this February. The Apache Arrow community is
discussing a 0.13 release toward the end of March, so we spent February helping
the project toward the next release milestone. We have been pushing projects on
multiple fronts and discuss some of those here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ursalabs.org/blog/2019-01/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a busy January that went by too quickly. After a high-intensity 3 months
of development, we helped release &lt;a href=&#34;http://arrow.apache.org/release/0.12.0.html&#34;&gt;Apache Arrow 0.12&lt;/a&gt; on January 20th. A
good chunk of our time was spent fighting fires (in packaging and builds)
related to the continued expansion of the project in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that NVIDIA AI Labs has signed on as a supporter of Ursa Labs. NVIDIA&amp;rsquo;s new open source RAPIDS data science platform uses Apache Arrow for an interoperable representation of tabular data (data frames). We are looking forward to collaborating on our respective development roadmaps and growing the ecosystem of projects that use Arrow.
This new financial support will enable us to grow our team of full-time open source software developers.</description>
